Docker lets you manage the containers on your hosts from Termix: start, stop, restart, pause and remove them, watch their stats, read their logs and open a shell inside them. It works with Docker and Podman.

It talks to your hosts over SSH, the same way the terminal does. It never needs the Docker socket exposed, and there is nothing to install on the host besides Docker or Podman.

## Set up a host

1. Make sure the SSH user can run Docker without sudo. Check by running `docker ps` in a terminal on the host. If it asks for a password or says permission denied, add the user to the `docker` group and sign in again:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

2. Open the host in **Manage** and turn on **Enable Docker** in the Docker section.
3. If the host uses Podman, set **Container Runtime** to **Podman**.
4. Save. Open the host's menu and pick **Docker**.

## What you can do

- **Containers.** See every container with its image, state, ports and uptime. Start, stop, restart, pause, unpause or remove them.
- **Stats.** Live CPU, memory, network and disk use per container.
- **Logs.** Read a container's logs, follow them live, and download them.
- **Console.** Open a shell inside a running container.

## With other plugins

- [Automations](/plugins/automations) can run when a container exits, starts, restarts or turns unhealthy, and can start, stop or restart containers as a step.
- [AI Assistant](/plugins/ai) can read `docker ps` and `docker logs` output when you allow read-only commands.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing shows up.** Run `docker ps` as the SSH user in a terminal. If that fails, Docker will fail too.
- **Permission denied.** The user isn't in the `docker` group, or hasn't signed in again since being added.
- **The host can't connect.** Open a terminal to it first. Docker uses the same login, so a sign in problem shows up there too.

Who can use it is set by the `docker.use` permission. Admins and users have it at first.
